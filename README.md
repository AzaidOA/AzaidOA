# Hi, I'm Azaid! 👩🏽‍🔬🧑🏽‍🔬

Welcome to the cove of my codes! You can pronounce my name like the fruit "acai," but with a "d" at the end. I recently graduated from the undergraduate program in Genomics Sciences at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. With a strong passion for biology and technology, I have gained valuable hands-on experience through various research projects in the fields of immunology and infectious diseases.

## Professional Experience

🔬 I am currently working as a Junior Bioinformatician at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. Here, I have honed my skills in analyzing single-cell data using programming languages such as R and Python. Collaborating with talented and supportive scientists, I successfully completed a published project on macrophage differentiation and plasticity during my research stay at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases.

## Interests and Hobbies

🌆 During my free time, I love exploring the city while indulging in expensive chai lattes. It's a great way to relax and enjoy the vibrant atmosphere around me. Family is important to me, and I cherish spending quality time with my loved ones and pets.

## Future Goals

🎓 As I approach graduation, I am eager to continue my education and professional development in the field of genomics. My goal is to enhance my skills as a data scientist and contribute to biomedical scientific research. I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and look forward to making a positive impact in the field.

Feel free to browse through my repositories and explore the projects I've been working on. Let's collaborate and make a difference in the world of genomics and data science!
